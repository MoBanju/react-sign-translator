## Description
The application have a login, translate and profile page. The login page will take a username as input, and log in if exists, and make new user if not. The user is then sent to the translation page. Here the user can enter text with max length of 40, and get an output of this text translated to sign language. In the users profile, one can see your ten last translated texts. These can be cleared with a button. At the profile, the user can also log out.

The user can navigate around by clicking icons and links in the navbar.
## Prototype
There has been few changes after the prototype was made:
- The header does not have any profile info because of personal styling choices.
- Login page now only directs the user to the translation page
- Profile page have recent translations and profile actions, which includes the actions: logout and clear translations history
